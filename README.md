A-Maze
======

This JavaScript project is a POC (Proof Of Concept) showing the use of the
following technologies:

- promises,
- canvas,
- HTML import,
- HTML template,
- custom elements

It requires a browser supporting these technologies in order to run.

The main program is `maze-app.html`. The web component is contained in
`a-maze.html` and defines the `a-maze` custom tag.

The project uses a tile sheet from the "Simplified Platformer Pack" from
Kenney Vleugels (Kenney.nl).
